Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. 
Today, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide with 17.9 million deaths annually, as per the World Health Organization reports 
The correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. 
In this project different machine learning algorithms and deep learning are applied to compare the results and analysis of the UCI Machine Learning Heart Disease dataset. 
The dataset consists of 14 main attributes used for performing the analysis. Various promising results are achieved and are validated using accuracy and confusion matrix. 
The dataset consists of some irrelevant features which are handled and data are also normalized for getting better results.
